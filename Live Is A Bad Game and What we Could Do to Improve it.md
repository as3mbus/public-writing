# Game and Live Similarity

## Rules

our live already have rules that bound us to law of physics, limitation of human body, etc

## Core Loop

Our Live consist of many loop, that discover a problem, and finding / applying a solution

## Tutorial

every newborn human are given parent that act as a mentor, providing tutorial and many knowledge base in order for their offspring to catch up with human knowledge

## Game Content

There are way too much game content within the universe as humanity expand their knowledge, discover new stuff, that provided by the universe.

## Resources

there are lots of resource in the universe that human can discover, create stuff out from, and sell their human quality, knowledge, entertainment, etc.

## RPG Elements

Every creature in this world is unique. including ourselves that can be developed much further, and personalized way too much.

# What makes Games More Fun than Lives

## Limited Information

as is how classic / legacy server works. there are a point where having complete knowledge of our surroundings make Lives much more comfortable. it's always a risk and fear when we get out of our comfort zone

## Becoming Self that we aren't able to be, never thought to be, hard to be, etc2

Game provide a way for us to become anyone we want. from hard boiled soldier, valiant heroes, or bloodthirsty killer. without the precaution of live judgements.

this also helps us understand better on other POV on what we would do when we placed in that situation as that character

## Providing Good Feedbacks on every actions

every action we did in our live will finally start to gets dull, and becoming more and more boring, becoming chore, until finally we don't want to do it anymore.

game mitigate this with providing progression, achievement, satisfying and quick feedback, that we don't usually get in our daily lives.

providing score, difficulty estimation. and many more form of gamification process helps a lot with this. making a data that describe what, why. who

## Less Commitment to experience something new

Switching between game is as simple as stopping and starting other new game. unlike real live commitment to a marriage, job, Schedule.

## Never Judge Us
