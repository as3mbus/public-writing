# Popular Writing Structures

Most writing structure i found within all tools below follow similar structure where there are a node with a title name and content.

```yaml
some title
    content
    content
    content

another title
    content
    content
```

aside from `text` content, these `content` can also come in the form of `command` that controls the flow, and possible effects of the narrative. The most basic command that feature are already provided within all of these narrative tools are the `choice` , and `jump` providing basic functionality of the basic choice narrative book. for more advanced user there always `variable` and `condition` that helps to make narrative into a game that is more dynamic. additional advanced toolkit that provided is the ability to invoke `custom command` that can be made within your custom / their `narrative engine`. there also a possibility to make custom command within the `narrative scripts` see `Ink`.

# RenPy

Visual Novel engine that provide most used visual novel feature including transition etc2.

not flexibly extendable as it is a single engine as itself

the writing format contain of text, choice, command, and section

# Ink

most basic structure

least feature

might as well serve as narrative data format

Writing structure similar to renpy

any effects feature must be created by developer and implemented accordingly

more of a data structure / module instead of engine

# Yarn Spinner

Writing structure similar to renpy

have more rigid story runner compared to ink

more complicated than ink which means more feature

localization feature

using many brackets and symbol

# Twine [ Cradle ]

cradle is one of maybe many other twine integrator for unity

similar writing structure but with better user interface

need additional research

not much resource from internet

aren't really related to unity.

popular tool for text based narrative in general

kind of restricting developer to work with twine limit

people just made a tool to use the data within the unity
